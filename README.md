Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This simple console-based game allows players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides a user-friendly interface and offers different difficulty levels.

## How to Play

1. Run the script in your terminal.
2. The game will display a logo and prompt you to choose a difficulty level (easy or hard).
3. The computer will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
4. You have a limited number of turns to guess the correct number.
5. After each guess, the game will inform you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
6. If you run out of turns, the game will end, and you will be informed that you lost.
7. If you correctly guess the number within the given turns, you win!
